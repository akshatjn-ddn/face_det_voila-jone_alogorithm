As mentioned before, here we are going to see how we can detect faces by using an Image-based approach.MTCNN or Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network is unquestionably one of the most popular and most accurate face detection tools that work this principle. As such, it is based on a deep learning architecture, it specifically consists of 3 neural networks (P-Net, R-Net, and O-Net) connected in a cascade.

So, letâ€™s see how we can use this algorithm in Python to detect faces in real-time. First, you need to install MTCNN library which contains a trained model that can detect faces.
